  <!-- About Section -->
  <section class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-6 py-16" id="about">
    <h3 class="text-3xl font-semibold text-accent mb-6">About Me</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      Iâ€™m a data analyst and AI enthusiast originally from Tajikistan â€” a small, mountainous country in Central Asia. Growing up in a place where access to advanced technology was limited only fueled my curiosity. Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by how things work â€” from the cosmos to computers â€” and that early passion led me to pursue a future in data, artificial intelligence, and systems design.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      Achieving my dream of studying in the United States, I earned my degree from the University of Nebraska at Kearney. During that time, I built real-world tools â€” including a predictive model for healthcare billing and an AI-powered chatbot that integrates document ingestion, OpenAI GPT, and vector search.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
      I currently serve as a Graduate Assistant for the Office of Graduate Studies and Academic Innovation at UNK. In this role, I support academic program development, analyze student success data, assist in marketing efforts, and help enhance institutional effectiveness through data-driven reporting.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg">
      Iâ€™m passionate about using technology to make systems smarter and more human-centered. My goal is to build tools that solve real problems and improve lives.

        <!-- UNK AI Chatbot -->
        <div>
          <h4 class="text-xl font-bold text-white">UNK AI Chatbot â€“ Intelligent Campus Assistant for Students & Staff</h4>
<p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">Tech Stack: Python, Flask, WebSockets, React.js, Tailwind CSS, MongoDB, Pinecone, OpenAI GPT-3.5</p>
<p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">
  This full-stack AI-powered chatbot was built as a capstone project to modernize student support at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. Designed for both students and staff, the chatbot can answer academic, administrative, and campus-related queries in real time using an intelligent backend pipeline that mimics how a real university help desk operates â€” but faster, smarter, and 24/7.
</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-400 mb-2">
  <li><strong>GPT Integration for Conversational Intelligence:</strong> Utilized OpenAIâ€™s GPT API to generate accurate, natural language responses tailored to UNKâ€™s academic and support resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Document Ingestion & Vector Embedding:</strong> Parsed UNKâ€™s website, converted pages into semantic vectors using OpenAI embeddings, and indexed them in Pinecone for context-aware search.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Multi-User Chat System:</strong> Developed a WebSocket-based backend allowing live group interactions and simultaneous sessions.</li>
  <li><strong>Role-Based Access System (RBAC):</strong> Created distinct UI behavior and access logic for students vs. staff.</li>
  <li><strong>Modern Frontend Architecture:</strong> Built a responsive React interface with Tailwind CSS, including markdown-rendered answers and a polished user experience.</li>
</ul>
<p class="text-gray-300">
  <strong>Impact:</strong> The chatbot significantly reduced routine question volume for advisors, streamlined access to policies and deadlines, and served as a scalable support tool. It was tested on real UNK web data and is deployable as a plug-in or popup assistant across academic websites.

          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-2">Tech Stack: Python, Excel, Data Visualization, Probability Modeling, IRT, Custom Dataset Engineering</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-400 mb-2">
            <li>Created a tool to estimate billing error likelihood based on treatment complexity</li>
            <li>Simulated stage-based procedure counts due to HIPAA limitations</li>
            <li>Applied binomial probability to forecast compound billing error risks</li>
            <li>Used statistical logic from IRT and Cronbachâ€™s Alpha for consistency validation</li>
            <li>Collaborated on data sourcing, model design, and scenario testing</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-300">Result: Demonstrated a sharp increase in billing error probability with procedure count â€” crossing 50% error risk after a certain threshold.</p>
